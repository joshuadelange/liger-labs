				<p>We Receive This Cup is a documentary that shows how counter to popular assumptions, the church has been pivotal in developing many of the alcoholic beverages we enjoy today and, by extension, has played a central role in the way we understand and drink it in our modern culture. Working broadly in three parts and from early history to now, by showing the relationship of beer, wine and spirits to the church, the film will uncover the key philosophical frameworks that have inspired us to drink the way we do.</p>
